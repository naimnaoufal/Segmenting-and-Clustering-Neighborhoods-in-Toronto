# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
In this project, I will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto to find out which neighborhoods are similar to each other.

The map 1 contains the visualization of the neighbourhoods in Toronto.

The map 2 contains the clusters of neighbourhoods using the *K*-Means Machine Learning algorithm.
